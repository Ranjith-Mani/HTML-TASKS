        Vinesh Phogat is one of India's most accomplished and celebrated female
        wrestlers. Born on August 25, 1994, in Balali, Haryana, she comes from
        the famous Phogat family, known for producing several top-level
        wrestlers. Vinesh is the cousin of wrestlers Geeta and Babita Phogat,
        both of whom have represented India at international levels.
      </p>
      <p class="p2">
        Vinesh began her wrestling career at a young age, inspired by her
        family's legacy and her uncle Mahavir Singh Phogat, who trained her. She
        quickly rose through the ranks, becoming one of India's leading female
        wrestlers. Her achievements include multiple gold medals at the
        Commonwealth Games, Asian Games, and other international tournaments.
        Notably, she won gold in the 48 kg category at the 2014 Commonwealth
        Games and the 50 kg category at the 2018 Commonwealth Games.
      </p>
      <p class="p3">
        Vinesh Phogat's career has been marked by resilience and determination.
        In 2016, she suffered a serious knee injury during the Rio Olympics,
        which sidelined her for several months. However, she made a remarkable
        comeback, winning gold at the 2018 Asian Games and qualifying for the
        2020 Tokyo Olympics.
      </p>
      <p class="p4">
        In addition to her wrestling accolades, Vinesh is known for breaking
        barriers and inspiring a new generation of female athletes in India. She
        has become a symbol of empowerment, advocating for women's rights and
        equality in sports. Her story has been an inspiration not only in India
        but globally, showcasing the strength, dedication, and perseverance
        required to succeed in sports.
